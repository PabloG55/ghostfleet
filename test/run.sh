# of them was SILENT — the code kept running and produced a plausible wrong answer:
#
#   - a trust stanza written under the logical path, which codex (reading the
#     physical one) never matched: looked exactly like success
#   - a ready pattern that matched only outside $HOME, so it matched nowhere real
#   - two separate "the last variable absorbs the rest" field bugs
#   - a busy regex that can't fire, which is indistinguishable from an idle worker
#
# That last one is why the pane assertions run in BOTH directions. A detector is only
# proven by matching a real busy capture AND not matching a real idle one; testing
# only the happy direction would pass for a regex that matches everything, and pass
# for one that matches nothing. Fixtures are verbatim captures from real panes.
